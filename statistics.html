            <p>While the number of rocket launches per year compared to commercial flights is considerably smaller, this doesn’t negate the fact that a single rocket produces the same amount of CO2 emissions as nearly 400 flights. Emissions produced by the space travel industry are increasing 5.6% per year, so while their carbon footprint pales in comparison to airline companies and automobiles at the moment, they will soon catch up. Since the end goal of many of these privatized space companies is to commercialize space travel, making it available to the general public, we cannot ignore how this will only lead to increased levels of pollution being pumped into Earth’s atmosphere.</p>

            <p>While the prospect of normalizing space travel is exciting, we live in an age where record temperatures, ravaging wildfires, and other natural disasters have become a part of daily life. Spending millions launching these billionaires into space for a joy ride around a dying Earth hardly seems important. Before setting our sights on colonizing other planets, as Elon Musk wants to, we should consider how pouring money into projects to preserve the planet we already call home might be worth focusing on at the moment.</p>
